      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <h3>How does PACS improve radiology workflow?</h3>
      <p>PACS allows radiologists to upload and retrieve images instantly. Clinicians can review images alongside EMR notes in one place.</p>

      <h3>Is modality scheduling customizable?</h3>
      <p>Yes. You can configure modality rooms, slot duration, priority flags, and technician allocation.</p>
   
      <h3>Can radiologists view DICOM images in the same system?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Nutryah‚Äôs RIS includes a built-in PACS viewer that supports DICOM, annotations, and multi-modal image comparisons.</p>

      <h3>How are final reports managed?</h3>
      <p>Reports go through a dual-review process, are finalized by senior radiologists, and then auto-notified to the ordering physician.</p>
      
      
      <h3>Can radiologists customize reporting templates?</h3>
      <p>Yes. Structured reporting templates can be customized for each modality ‚Äî CT, MRI, USG, X-Ray, etc.</p>

      <h3>How are patients notified of results?</h3>
      <p>Patients can receive alerts via email or mobile once a report is finalized, and access it securely via the patient portal.</p>
